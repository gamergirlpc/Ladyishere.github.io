# Context

Client: Family memebers who want to show off our dog to others

Goal: to create a page where I can show others pictures of my dog (aside from Instagram), and so people can inquire about having doggy play-dates. My dog is quite old, so it would be a great way to remember his best years.

## Assignment 1 - Nav Bar

Assignment one is on home page index.html, simple landing page that connects to second page - about me.
This connects my main nav bar with my hero page created with my SVG

## Assignment 2 - Cards

I started on assignment two, by adding a page to my "about me" section. I added a snipped of more information about my dog, and also added in 3 profile cards for family members.

- To do: Add in descriptions of family members in paragraph section, replace lorem text

## Assignment 3 - Image Gallery

Assignment three starts on the "gallery" section.

- need to add in header
- Social media links were added from the start in the footer section
